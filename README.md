# Another tasks

[https://madox2.github.io/another-tasks/](https://madox2.github.io/another-tasks/)

Another Tasks is a simple TODO list application that uses Google Tasks API to store the data. You can create and manage your tasks here and they will be available in all google services like calendar, etc.


## Motivation

As the Google shut down Canvas interface for Google Tasks in early 2019, they didn't provide any full-screen alternative for desktop users. Therefore I have decided to create this web app for the users that are missing the Canvas and don't feel confortable with it's replacement (GMail task addon).

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
